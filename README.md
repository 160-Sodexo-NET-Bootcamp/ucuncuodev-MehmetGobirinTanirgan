#### K Means Algorithm Testing On Real Map

- At the start of test scenario, we have a vehicle with 8 default containers. I chose the locations of these containers from google maps randomly.
- <strong>Notes:</strong> 
    - <ins> Each color on the map represents a cluster. </ins>
    - <ins> The 'n' parameter represents number of clusters that we request from API. </ins>
    - <ins> The 'c' parameter represents number of containers. </ins>
- The pins on the map colorized by me according to the result from the API.

1. First scenario (c = 8, n = 3)

3. Third scenario, added 2 more locations from map. (c = 11, n = 3)
